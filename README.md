# teacher_tools_file
tools site for teachers

## GitHub Pages (`/docs`)

- Set GitHub Pages source to `/docs`.
- Entry point is `docs/index.html`, which redirects to `docs/teacher_tools.html`.
- Root files remain the editable source; `docs/` is the publish copy.

After editing root teacher tools files, run:

```bash
npm run sync:docs
```
